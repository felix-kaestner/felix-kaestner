## Hi. ðŸ‘‹

### My name is Felix KÃ¤stner.

I am a software developer and solutions architect specialized in mobile and ubiquitous computing. I live in Dresden where I studied Computer Science at [Technische UniversitÃ¤t Dresden](https://tu-dresden.de), receiving the academic title _Master of Science_. 

I work as a developer for the [RiDE](https://radverkehr-in-deutschland.de) (previously [Movebis](https://www.movebis.org)) research project doing WebGL-powered data visualizations of large geographic datasets for traffic analysis. Besides, I currently work on developing mobile applications (mostly Android) together with my good friend [Philipp Matthes](https://github.com/philippmatthes). We previously prototyped [PeerBridge](https://github.com/peerbridge) an anonymous messenger based on Blockchain and DPoS. Additionally, we were rebuilding the [OUTPUT.DD](https://output-dd.de) [Apps](https://github.com/output-dd).

I'm currently accepting freelance work. You can contact me at [hello@felix-kaestner.com](hello@felix-kaestner.com)

I was previously employed at [MARKENZOO](https://markenzoo.de), where I worked as a web developer, creating and maintaining a variety of different projects mainly focused around [Contao CMS](https://contao.org).

I strive to learn new things and develop skills in a range of different areas.ðŸŒ± If you have an interesting project or want to ask me anything ðŸ’¬, you can reach out and send me a [mail](hello@felix-kaestner.com). ðŸ“« You can also find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kaestner_felix) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/felix-kaestner).

âš¡ Fun fact: I am the winner of the 1st Thuringian Computer Science Competition.

Outside of programming, I enjoy doing strength training and listening to music. Also, I am a coffee lover! â˜•
